The AutoSwap contract serves as a decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator, built on two underlying DEX platforms: Canto DEX and Cadence DEX. Its purpose is to provide users with a unified interface to interact with multiple DEXs and find the best route or split for achieving the optimal trade price.
